ESPLIB.APIEnabled(Type <string>, obj <instance>)

The Types could be:
"Perm"
"Players"
"Objects"

these are to seperate players and objects for better ESP Managment
Perm can not be deleted! Be careful what you put here(they can if you go into the game files and manually delete it via DarkDex.

ESPLIB.Disable(Type <string>)

This can delete all ESP's in a certain group aka I would like to destroy all Object ESP's ill do ESPLIB.Disable("Objects")

Example of Code

local ESP_Lib = loadstring(game:HttpGet(""))()

ESP_Lib.APIEnabled("Objects", game.Workspace.Baseplate)

task.wait(1)

ESP_Lib.Disable("Objects")
